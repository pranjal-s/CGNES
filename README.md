# CGNES: Coarse-Grained Nuclear Envelope Simulator

This repository is initialized to serve these purposes: (a) creating from CGNPS
a simplified code for simulation of just the nuclear envelope, and (b) use in a
collaborative project with my previous advisor at Penn State to improve the
nuclear envelope model while studying some interesting nuclear envelope
properties and abnormalities.

### Progress

Currently working on (a).
