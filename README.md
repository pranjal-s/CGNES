# CGNES: Coarse-Grained Nuclear Envelope Simulator

This repository is forked from mechbio/CGNPS to serve these purposes: (a) creating from CGNPS a simplified code for simulation of just the nuclear envelope, and (b) improving the nuclear envelope model while studying some interesting nuclear envelope properties and abnormalities.

### Progress

(a) is done. This is a visualization of simulation of the nuclear envelope:

Update on (b) is expected to come by the end of the year.
